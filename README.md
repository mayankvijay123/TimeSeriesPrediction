# Time Series Prediction on Road Dataset

# Objective
To predict the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 on each section from a dataset of 10 years.

# Model Used
In this project I have used Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict values of five variables. I used it to predict the values of Para 9,10,11,12,13. Then I made some scatter plots of it corresponding to each variable.

# Results
The RMSE value of the model is 46.35
