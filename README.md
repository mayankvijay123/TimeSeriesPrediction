# Time Series Prediction on Road Dataset

# Objective
To predict the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 on each section from a dataset of 10 years.

# Model Used 
In this project I have used Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict values of five variables. <br />
I used it to predict the values of Para 9,10,11,12,13. <br />
Then I made some scatter plots corresponding to each variable.

# Results
The RMSE value of the model is 46.35
